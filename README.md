# MyFirstAnalysisInDNA
Here, my first program for DNA analysis, you can see the dna bases (A,T,G,C) as well as you can count how many bases in your DNA file; for example,"AAGGTTCCAGTC" here you can count them,A=3,T=3,G=3 and C=3. What if i have 3 billions of bases ? how can i count them ? YES, the answer is by using camputer.
Go to file called DNA Analysis and see my codes.
If anyone can make my codes faster,eseaier,and simple. please help my me if you can.
